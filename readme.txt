Link Detox — Static Demo

A simple phishing detection demo that runs entirely on the client-side, designed for hosting on GitHub Pages.

Features
- Check a URL — assigns a random risk score (0–100%) for demo purposes.
- Preview Website — embeds the target site in an iframe (note: some sites block embedding).
- Report Phishing — users can submit suspicious URLs (saved in their browser’s localStorage).
- Reported URLs — view the locally stored phishing reports.


Notes
- Reports are saved in localStorage only (not shared across users).
- Some websites may not load in the preview iframe due to security headers.
